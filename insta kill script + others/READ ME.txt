fyi, this script has inf range aslong are you are being targeted by rake, it will NOT work if rake isn't targeting you

it has no gui, and nothing will pop up when you execute it. 

it skips bloodhour, and will just kill him everytime

you dont need power for this to work and like i said, it wont work if the rake isnt targeting you

the other stuff thats in here is useful, and is cool stuff that you can play around with

the other scripts are from the global scripts and their called 'unfairhub'

when you load unfairhub i recommend using 'lynx+realzzhub' and if you want 'project rake'
